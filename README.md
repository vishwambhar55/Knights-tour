# Knight's Tour

Created a UI for Knight tour program which takes Knights current position as input via mouse click on the chessboard.

## About Knight Tour Problem

A knight's tour is a sequence of moves of a knight on a chessboard such that the knight visits every square exactly once. If the knight ends on a square that is one knight's move from the beginning square (so that it could tour the board again immediately, following the same path), the tour is closed (or re-entrant); otherwise, it is open.
